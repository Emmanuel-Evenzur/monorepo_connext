/**
 * @notice This interface is what the Connext contract will send and receive messages through.
 * The messaging layer should conform to this interface, and should be interchangeable (i.e.
 * could be Nomad or a generic AMB under the hood).
 *
 * @dev This uses the nomad format to ensure nomad can be added in as it comes back online.
 *
 * Flow from transfer from polygon to optimism:
 * 1. User calls `xcall` with destination specified
 * 2. This will swap in to the bridge assets
 * 3. The swapped assets will get burned
 * 4. The Connext contract will call `dispatch` on the messaging contract to add the transfer
 *    to the root
 * 5. [At some time interval] Relayers call `send` to send the current root from polygon to
 *    mainnet. This is done on all "spoke" domains.
 * 6. [At some time interval] Relayers call `propagate` [better name] on mainnet, this generates a new merkle
 *    root from all of the AMBs
 *    - This function must be able to read root data from all AMBs and aggregate them into a single merkle
 *      tree root
 *    - Will send the mixed root from all chains back through the respective AMBs to all other chains
 * 7. AMB will call `update` to update the latest root on the messaging contract on spoke domains
 * 8. [At any point] Relayers can call `proveAndProcess` to prove inclusion of dispatched message, and call
 *    process on the `Connext` contract
 * 9. Takes minted bridge tokens and credits the LP
 *
 * AMB requirements:
 * - Access `msg.sender` both from mainnet -> spoke and vice versa
 * - Ability to read *our root* from the AMB
 *
 * AMBs:
 * - PoS bridge from polygon
 * - arbitrum bridge
 * - optimism bridge
 * - gnosis chain
 * - bsc (use multichain for messaging)
